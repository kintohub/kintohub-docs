## Roll back a version

The Rollback feature is used to revert deployments to a previous state or version. This is especially useful when a deployment that was pushed causes instability or makes the existing features dysfunctional.

To rollback a deployment, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open a **Deployment**.

2. Click on Expand Deployment History displayed in the **Status & History** section.

3. Click on the **Rollback** button displayed for an existing deployment made.

Now, the deployment will automatically rollback to the previous version.
