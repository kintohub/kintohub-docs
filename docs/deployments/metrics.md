## Grafana Metrics

We have integrated Grafana metrics with your environment. The dashboard view of the metrics helps you to filter the statistics based on your workspace or environment.

These metrics are helpful to perform health checks on the environment and to troubleshoot issues.

To view metrics for an environment, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open a **Project**.

2. Click on the **Metrics** button displayed on the top right of the **Project Manage** page.

- CPU usage.

- Memory Usage.

- Average Recieve Bytes.

- Average Transmit Bytes.

- Uptime.

- Number of Instances
