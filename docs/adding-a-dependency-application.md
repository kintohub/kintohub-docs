Once you've created an application, you can add additional KintoBlocks to extend its capabilities.

1. Open the **KintoBlock** or **Application** you want to edit
2. Under the **Dependencies** section, search for the Kintoblock you would like to add
3. Click **Edit Dependencies** to modify their custom parameters and hardware requirements
4. You can choose any **Tag** for each dependency
5. You can also choose a **Branch** - the latest from the branch will be used
