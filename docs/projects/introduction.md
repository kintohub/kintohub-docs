## What is a Project?

Projects are tailored back-end features packages, ready to be consumed by your clients.
They are composed of KintoBlocks with unique configuration parameters, and either a client or a protocol to allow your clients to talk to the application. You can deploy your app in a specific environment and have several environments for one application to apply different custom configurations.

Your Project is made of blocks that are deployed in a serverless way, meaning it is dynamically loaded when you are calling your endpoint. Hence, if you are not using it, you are saving resources and money!


## Creating a Project

1. Select **Projects** from the sidebar.

2. Click **Create New Project** card or the **+** icon.

4. By default, the environment is named as **default**. Make sure to overwrite it and specify your own name for easier identification.

5. Under KintoBlocks section, search for the Kintoblock you would like to add.

6. Select the KintoBlock displayed in the search dropdown to add them to your project. Both **private** and **public** KintoBlocks can be added.

8. Click on **Create New Project** button on the bottom right of the page to create the Project.

   >Note: When the **Automatically deploy when new KintoBlock commits are available** option is set to `ON`, new commits in the KintoBlock are automatically deployed. By default, the toggle switch is set to `OFF`.

## View Projects

The projects created by a user are listed under My Projects in Projects List page. Each stack in My Project represents a project. To view the details of the project, click on the stack corresponding to it.
