## Roll back a version

The Rollback feature is used to revert projects to a previous state or version. This is especially useful when a project that was pushed causes instability or makes the existing features dysfunctional.

To rollback a project, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open a **Project**.

2. Click on Expand Project History displayed in the **Status & History** section.

3. Click on the **Rollback** button displayed for an existing project made.

Now, the project will automatically rollback to the previous version.
