## Workspace billing

Plans are billed on monthly basis per workspace. If you have [created multiple workspaces](features/workspaces-and-teams/workspace-intro.md), select the workspace you would like to inspect from the menu.

The *__Billing__* section on the _Manage Workspace_ page lists all the consumption details of your plan and allows you to configure scaling.

### Current plan

The base monthly fees are listed here.

If you are on the Free plan, you can use the __Upgrade__ button to [upgrade to a Pro plan](upgrading.md).

### Renewal Cycle

This section lists the total fees; base plan + extras combined. The extras are determined by the consumption of additional resources this month. That consumption is determined by the _Budget Settings_.

## Scaling with budgets

At KintoHub we take an unconventional approach to scaling. We allow your resources to _scale dynamically within a predefined budget_. This prevents bill-shock, whilst still having the capability to scale your resources on demand.

This means you can _indicate how much you are willing to spend extra_ on a monthly basis on top of your base plan fees.

### Extra resources

When your KintoBlocks need to scale to handle extra load, or if you need to deploy additional KintoBlocks, the extra budget will be consumed with the _price per GB for additional memory and/or storage_. The cost of these add-ons are listed on the [Pricing](https://www.kintohub.com) page on the website.

Extras are charged pro-rated for the first month. The following month you will be charged again for the same additional resources in full. If you have freed up these additional resources during the month, then you won't be charged for them in the next month. Once resources are freed up, you can lower your budget if desired.

### Budget settings

You can set the budget in the _Budget Settings_ area in the *__Billing__* section of the *__Manage Workspace__* page.

 - Enter in the __Max Monthly Spend__ field the amount for your total budget, this includes your base fee.
 - Press __Save Changes__ to apply the new budget.

### Monitoring consumption

Extra resources that are consumed within the budget beyond the resources included with the base plan are listed in the _Renewal Cycle_ area in the *__Billing__* section of the *__Manage Workspace__* page.

We will also alert you per email when you consume new extra resources as part of your budget.
