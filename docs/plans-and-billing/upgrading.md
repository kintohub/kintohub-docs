> The [Pricing](https://www.kintohub.com) page on the KintoHub website lists a side-by-side comparison and all differences between the Free, Pro and Enterprise plans.

## Resources and features

KintoHub offers a [free plan](plans.md) that is great for exploring how KintoHub works and test it out for development and test workloads. When your apps start to grow, you may find that you need additional resources, and you could consider upgrading to the [pro plan](plans.md).

### Reasons for upgrading

 - More memory (RAM) needed
 - More storage (disk) needed
 - Custom Services with Helm charts
 - More than 3 team members
 - Access to support over email and Slack

### Encountering limitations

 - Unable to deploy because a KintoBlock requires more memory than available in the workspace
 - Unable to invite more members to the team

## Upgrading from the Free plan to the Pro plan

To see your plan and how much you are consuming, select __Manage Workspace__ in the sidebar of the KintoHub dashboard.

The *__Total Usage__* section shows your _Memory Usage_ and reflects the current consumption and remaining amount of memory. When all memory has been consumed, or the remaining amount is less than the memory needed for a new KintoBlock or new environment, then you may experience that projects fail.

### Upgrade

To upgrade from the Free plan to Pro, press the __Upgrade__ button under _Current Plan_ in the *__Billing__* section.

In the slide panel you can see that you are purchasing the monthly _Pro plan_.

 - Enter the __name on your credit card__, and
 - Fill out the __credit card number__, __expiration date__ and __verification code__.

The summary shows the monthly fee and the pro-rated amount for this month.

 - Press __Confirm Upgrade__ in the top right, to confirm the purchase.

### Pro plan

Once the payment is processed, you will immediately see the upgraded plan.

The Pro plan comes with an increased base amount of 2048MB memory, and allows you to set a _Budget Setting_ for scaling when you have extra memory and storage needs. Refer to the [Billing](billing.md) documentation for more guidance.
