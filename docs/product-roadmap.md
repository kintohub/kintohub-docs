We don't talk about future products... just kidding.

*  Ability to create teams within each workspace

*  Message passing and shared memory will be added to dependencies

*  Prometheus and Zipkin will be added to supported analytics services

*  Analytics will be displayed within our website

*  And so much more...

You can always contact us if there's a feature you would like to see, or add it to our [GitHub backlog](https://github.com/kintohub/backlog).
