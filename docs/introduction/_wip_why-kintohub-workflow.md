## Why a simplified workflow helps

We believe there are great benefits for users of KintoHub in having a much simpler workflow.

### Spend less time on learning tooling

The workflow abstracts a lot of amazing, but often complicated tools and processes. You can still _get the benefits without needing to learn_ how to use these tools and processes one by one.

We have done the _vetting_, and have _tried and tested_ the best configurations.

That means the workflow _works out of the box_, and there is _no steep learning curve_.

### Avoid tedious configuration files

### 

- Align Teams

## Under the hood

There has been a growing list of cloud-native technologies in the last few years. In fact, the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io) has a
[map of the cloud-native landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io), with a snapshot pictured below.

We really like the innovation that has happened in this space, and would love to bring the power of cloud native into the hands of developers.  Unfortunately today, cloud native methodologies require large teams to put together a platform of tools to help support the iterations of rapidly deploying updates at massive scale.
