## Why a simplified workflow helps

We believe there are great benefits for users of KintoHub in having a much simpler workflow.

### Spend less time on learning tooling

The workflow abstracts a lot of amazing, but often complicated tools and processes. You can still _get the benefits without needing to learn_ how to use these tools and processes one by one.

We have done the _vetting_, and have _tried and tested_ the best configurations.

That means the workflow _works out of the box_, and there is _no steep learning curve_.

### Avoid tedious configuration files

### 

- Align Teams

## Under the hood

There has been a growing list of cloud-native technologies in the last few years. In fact, the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io) has a
[map of the cloud-native landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io), with a snapshot pictured below.

We really like the innovation that has happened in this space, and would love to bring this to the masses.
