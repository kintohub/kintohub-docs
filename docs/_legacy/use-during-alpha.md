title: Is KintoHub free to use during alpha testing period?

Yes! KintoHub is completely free of charge during private alpha testing period.
There will be an usage cap but it's very unlikely to hit it.
If you did, just [drop us a line]((https://www.kintohub.com/contactus/) and we'll see what we can do :)
