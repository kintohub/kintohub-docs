title: Tagging & deploying an application
---

When you create an application it is by default in a _draft_ state. When you make changes to an application, ie. add a new dependency or change the version of a KintoBlock within this application, you can create a new tag.

Unlike KintoBlocks, this is unrelated to GitHub, but is a way to manage versions of your application.

When you tag an application this is marking it as ready for deployment and the application will be deployed.

This is useful if, for example, you add a dependency and everything breaks, you quickly can deploy a previous version of your app to revert your changes.

1. Open the **Application** you want to tag and deploy
2. Click **Tag & Deploy**
