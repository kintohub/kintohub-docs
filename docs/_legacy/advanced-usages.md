## Search and find KintoBlocks

The **Search bar** in KintoBlocks is intuitive and easy to use. The Search yields the lists of KintoBlocks created by **workspace members** and **publicly** shared on the platform. Search is especially helpful for developers looking for reusable KintoBlocks so that they can focus only on building unique components necessary for their application.
