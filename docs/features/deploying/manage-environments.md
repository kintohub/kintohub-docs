4. Click on the **Deploy** button displayed in Promote pop-up.

The environment gets deployed with the latest KintoBlocks available in the parent environment.


## Rollback version

The Rollback feature is used to revert deployments to a previous state or version. This is especially useful when a deployment that was pushed causes instability or makes the existing features dysfunctional.

To rollback a deployment, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open a **Deployment**.

2. Click on Expand Deployment History displayed in the **Status & History** section.

3. Click on the **Rollback** button displayed for an existing deployment made.

To shut down an environment, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open a **Deployment**.

2. Click on the **Shut Down** button displayed on the top right of the page.

3. Click on **Shut Down Anyway** button displayed in the shut down pop up.
