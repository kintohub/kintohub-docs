## Automatically Deploy your Apps

**Auto Deployment** toggle is used to automatically deploy and test light changes made in your successive builds of a KintoBlock version, without going through the hassle of manual deployment for each.

To enable **Auto Deployment**, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open an existing Deployment.

2. Scroll down to the KintoBlocks section.

3. Now enable Auto Deployment toggle.

4. Currently, to save the changes made, we need to rebuild and deploy the KintoBlock or edit environment variables.
