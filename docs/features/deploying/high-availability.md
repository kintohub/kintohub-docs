title: High Availability
---

This toggle is designed to allow a service to be set as highly available. When **High Availability** toggle is switched **On**, the instances in the project will be distributed across multiple servers and availability zones. Thus, allowing the service to have improved performance and more reliability.

This toggle is easily configurable and can be specified on an environment basis. It is recommended to enable this option in production environments and leave them disabled on staging or testing environments.

To enable **High Availability**, follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Open a **Project**.
2. Scroll down to the **KintoBlocks** section.
3. Click on the **Configure KintoBlocks** button.
4. Enable the toggle displayed for **High Availability**.
5. Click on the **Done Configuration** button.
