title: API Docs
---

To document your code you need to follow the [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com/) conventions

> apidoc is a way to document your api endpoints in code, that way your endpoint documentation is literally part of the code and it is going to always be up to date.

> On top of apidoc we are introducing some pre-defined groups that we parse internally and gives us the ability parse/translate data between protocols

The following is a sample doc for an endpoint

```
/** **  REQUIRED API DOCS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH KINTOHUB **
 * @api {POST} /vehicle/{type} Add a new vehicle to the logged in user's collection
 * @apiName AddVehicle
 * @apiHeader (Session) {String} auth-account-id Logged in User's Id
 * @apiHeader {String} kinto-authorization Logged in User's Id
 * @apiParam (Url) {String} type the vehicle type
 * @apiParam {String} model the vehicle model
 * @apiParam {String} name the vehicle name
 ** OPTIONAL API DOCS **
 * @apiSuccess (Session) {Object[]} vehicle-owned All the vehicles that the current user have
 * @apiSuccess {Object} data the vehicle object
 * @apiSuccess {String} data.id Unique id for the vehicle
 * @apiSuccess {String} data.type vehicle type
 * @apiSuccess {String} data.model vehicle model
 */
```

## Endpoint Info

### @api

the url and description for the endpoint

> the only difference between our version of apidoc and the official apidoc is the url params. In our platform we expects it in the following format /{param} but apidoc expects /:param

Example:

```
/**
 * @api {POST} /endpoint/{id} Description for the endpoint
 */
```

### @apiName

Name for the endpoint, acts as an identifier

Example

```
/**
 * @apiName AddVehicle
 */
```

## Request Info

### apiHeader

**Default Group**: `Header`

#### Groups

- `Header` When the clients sends data a header with the request
- `Session` When the endpoints wants to read data from the session (that has been exposed by another microservice). Will be inject in the request headers
- `Config` read the config data from kintohub

Example:

```
/**
 * @apiHeader {String} authorization kinto-authorization header
 * @apiHeader (Header) {String} content-type request's content type // Header group is optional, can be removed
 * @apiHeader (Session) {String} auth-account-id Logged in User's Id added by the session and injected when you add this line
 * @apiHeader (Config) {String} githubToken this is being added in kintohub and injected when you add this line
 */
```

### apiParam

**Default Group**: `Body`

#### Groups

- `Url`: Url param - Ex: `/users/:id`
- `QueryString`: Query String Param - Ex: `/users?sort=desc`
- `Body`: Request body field - Ex: `{ name: 'username' }`

Example:

```
/**
 * @apiParam (Url) {String} id the unique user's identifier
 * @apiParam (QueryString) {String} sort the sort order for the result
 * @apiParam {String} name the product's name
 * @apiParam (Body) {String} type the product's type
 */
```

## Response Info

What the endpoint is sending back in the body or saving in the session

### @apiSuccess & @apiError

##### Default Group

- `apiSuccess`: `200`
- `apiError`: `400`

#### Groups

- Status code
- `Session`

Example

```
/**
 * @apiSuccess {String} data.name name of the user
 * @apiSuccess {String} [data.age] optional age
 * @apiSuccess (200) {String} data.gender optional age // 200 group is optional, can be removed
 * @apiSuccess (201) {String} data resource created
 * @apiSuccess (Session) {String} microservice-account-id to be saved in session
 * @apiError {String} error.message the error message
 * @apiError (400) {String} error.name the error message for the name // 400 group is optional, can be removed
 * @apiError (404) {String} error.message resource not found message
 * @apiError (403) {String} error.message resource not found message
*/
```

In order for the endpoint to save data in the current session

- the session name must start with the microservice name Example: @apiSuccess (Session) {String} microservice-account-id
- technically to return the session, you return it as a custom header with the response

## `[optional]` and `{required}` fields

Part of apidoc specification if you want to mark a field as required you wrap the type with `{}` and `[]` for optional

```
 @apiError {String} [error.message] this is an optional field
 @apiParam {String} model.field this is a required field
```

## Ignore directory

This is a work in progress, but now if you don't want a folder to be parsed by apidoc (not going to be shown in the docs), the folder must start with:

```
_kintoignore
```

Example project with `_kintoignore`:

    .
    ├── _kintoignore-lib # all the files under this directory are not going to be parsed
    ├── src              # all the files here are going to be parsed
    └── ...

## View auto generated Documentation

One of the bonuses of documenting your code, you will be able to view the endpoints and there documentation in KintoHub

When you view a microservice you will find a view endpoints button

This is all the apidocs parsed from the microservice's code, the more info you add to the apidocs, the better documentation you will get.
