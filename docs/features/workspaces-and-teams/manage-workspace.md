## Workspace User Roles

Users added to a workspace for collaborating with the projects are called as **Members**.

Members can create KintoBlocks and Projects in the shared workspace. They also have permissions to view or edit projects of other members. Their access roles can be limited or controlled.

**Admins** have all the permissions that the Owner(creator) of the workspace has. The important role of an Admin is in linking workspace to repository resources, removing a member from the workspace and inviting new members to the workspace.

To assign a role for user follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Select the workspace from the **Workspace** field displayed in the sidebar.

2. Click on the **Edit** icon and get redirected to the **Workspace Manage** page.

3. Under the **Members** section, click on the **Role** field displayed beside the **member name** field.

4. Select the `role` of the user.
