## High Availability

This toggle gives the ability to enable high availability on a service. When `High Availability` toggle is turned on, your instances will spread across multiple servers and availability zones, thus helping you with better performance and reliable service.

This toggle can be easily configured and can be configured per environment. You may want to have high availability disabled for test environments, but staging and production may want this to be enabled.

To enable High Availability, follow the steps mentioned below:
1. Open an existing or new **Deployment**.

2. Scroll down to the **KintoBlocks** section.

3. Now enable **High Availability** toggle.

4. Currently, to save the changes made, we need to either re-build the blocks or make changes to the environment variables.
