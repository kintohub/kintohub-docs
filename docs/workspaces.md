## Overview

Workspaces are here to allow you to collaborate with people in your team.
Completely segreggated spaces will allow you to share kintoapps, kintoblocks and manage them in the same space.

You can invite people (who already registered) on the platform to collaborate with you on any project you may have in your workspace
