## Overview
Gatsby makes it easy to build websites and apps based on React. Taking a static gastby website and deploying it on KintoHub couldn't be easier!

## Deployment
1. Apply this template to your [Github](https://github.com/kintohub/gatsby-example/generate)
2. Create a [Website KintoBlock](https://beta.kintohub.com/app/dashboard/)
4. Set the **name** of your kinto block
5. Choose **Static from build** as your type
6. Choose `Node.js` as the **language** and `11.7.0` as the **version**
7. Set the **Build Command** as `npm install && npm run build`
8. Set the **Build Output Folder** as `/public/` (NOTE: You must have the trailing slash at the moment)

You're now good to go! Click **Create Website**. Now click **Build Latest Commit**

... The build takes about 4 minutes. Once complete, Click **Add to Project**

Follow the instruction to creating a new project. Once created, you can then click **Open** on your Gatsby block and see it running live!
