## Overview
Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.

[Live Example](https://vue-example-1d0d2-8caf9.web.master.kintohub.com)

## Deployment
1. Apply this template to your [Github](https://github.com/kintohub/vue-example/generate)
2. Connect your GithubApp to KintoHub.
3. Create a [Static Website from Build](https://docs.kintohub.com/docs/kintoblocks/websites) on KintoHub and select the Repository you just generated on your account.
4. Set the **name** of your kinto block
5. Choose `Node.js` as the **language** and `13.1-alpine` as the **version**
6. Set the **Build Command** as `npm install && npm run build`
7. Set the **Build Folder** as `/dist`

You're now good to go! Click **Create Website** and then on your Master branch click `Build Latest Commit`.

Once complete, Click  Now click `Add To Project`.
And now you're ready to go live Click `Deploy` and once done -> you can view your website by clicking `Open`
