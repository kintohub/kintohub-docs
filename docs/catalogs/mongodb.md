## Overview

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

## Deployment

- This takes around 1 minute to deploy
- This MongoDB even with 1 node is deployed as a replicaset so you will need to add `replicaSet` at the end of the [connection uri](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/#urioption.replicaSet).
- *\*You can deploy this catalog with default environment variables*
- *\*Some environment variables cannot be changed after deployment*

## FAQ

**Q: Why cannot connect to MongoDB?**
A: Copy the connection string by clicking `Connect` button. Only blocks that are deployed in the same environment can connect between each other.
