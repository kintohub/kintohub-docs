title: Environmental Parameters

## Coming soon!

This feature is not ready yet but you can follow this feature [here](https://github.com/kintohub/backlog/issues/18) on our [GitHub backlog](https://github.com/kintohub/backlog), where you can comment on any open issues, or add any issues you would like us to tackle.


You can add environmental parameters to a KintoBlock on the **KintoBlock Manage** page, in the Environmental & Custom Parameters section, where they can also be edited. Alternatively you can edit environmental parameters in the dependencies section of the **Application Manage** page by clicking on the edit button.
