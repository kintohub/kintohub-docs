## What is a KintoBlock?

KintoBlocks is the new standard format for building the stack of microservices for building your business. They are self-contained, containerized, universally compatible, language agnostic, combinable and shareable bricks of back-end logic. We like to think of them as Lego bricks of an application!

KintoHub takes off your shoulders the hassle of implementing a microservice architecture reducing the cost of a substantial investment in your infrastructure. We help you achieve scalability using modular architecture by a library of configuration management.

3. There are two types of KintoBlocks supported now: **Microservices** and **Website**. Choose the type of
KintoBlock that meets your needs.

   - **Microservice** - Create a feature or functionality that runs your business.
