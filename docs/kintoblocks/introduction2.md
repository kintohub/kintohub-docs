# Introduction

## What is a KintoBlock 

KintoBlocks is the new standard format for building the stack of microservices for building your business. They are self-contained, containerized, universally compatible, language agnostic, combinable and shareable bricks of back-end logic. We like to think of them as Lego bricks of an application!

KintoHub takes off your shoulders the hassle of implementing a microservice architecture reducing the cost of a substantial investment in your infrastructure. We help you achieve scalability using modular architecture by a library of configuration management.

## How to create a KintoBlock 

1. Select **KintoBlocks** from the sidebar.

2. Click **Create New KintoBlock** card or the **+** icon.

> Note: At this point, if you have not linked your workspace to your **Github** or **Bitbucket** account, you will be asked to associate your [workspace](workspaces.md). If you have already associated your workspace, please proceed to the next step.

3. There are two types of KintoBlocks currently supported: **Microservices** and **Website**. Choose the type of KintoBlock that meets your needs.

   - **Microservice** - Create a feature or functionality that runs your business.
   - **Website** - Create a static, dynamic or server-side rendered website.
   - **Custom Services** - coming soon
   - **Tasks** - coming soon
   - **Functions** - coming soon
   - **Cloud Service** - coming soon

## Creating a Microservice KintoBlock

1. If you have selected Microservices as the KintoBlock type, start-off by filling the **Basic Info form**.

2. In Basic Info form, specify details on `name`, `description`, `programming language` and `version` you would like to use.

   {TODO: Raven Add GIF video of entering a name, description and selecting language, version & repository type }

3. Next, specify the details pertaining to your repo sources in the **Repository form**.

> Note: You can create a **new repository** or specify an **existing repository**.

4. Enable the **Prepopulate repository switch** if you wish to import an example project to your repository. The example project will vary depending on the selected language.

   {TODO: Raven Add GIF video enabling pre-pop switch }

5. Select your git repo service. **GitHub** and **Bitbucket** services are currently supported by KintoBlocks.

6. The other properties `Protocol`, `Port`, `Build command`, `Run command` and `DOC format` are auto-filled based on the chosen language. These values are editable and can be changed if required.

> Note: API documentation for a KintoBlock is created when the **ApiDoc** option is selected in the **DOC format** dropdown. In case, documentation is not required, select the option **None** in the same dropdown. It is important to note that the build can fail if ApiDoc is not enabled.

7. Click on the **Create New KintoBlock** button to successfully create your KintoBlock for microservices.

When the KintoBlock is created, the real-time status of the builds can be viewed by expanding the build row. The **Open Log** button in the build row displays the events corresponding to each build. Logs are especially useful in identifying root causes when a build failure occurs.
  
## Creating a Website KintoBlock

1. If you are creating a Website, select the corresponding option in the type of KintoBlocks.

2. Fill in the `name` and `description` in the **Basic Info form**.

3. Select the **website type** in the drop-down. Right now, we only support **Dynamic Web Applications**. The support for static websites will be coming up soon!

   {TODO: Raven Add image of website type dropdown }

4. Proceed to the **Advanced Options** form to specify  `Port`, `Build command` and `Run command` details.

> Note: For example, a Dynamic Web Application project, the Build command is `npm install` which installs latest changes in your project and Run command is `npm start` which starts the environment of your application.

   {TODO: Raven Add image of Advanced options form }

5. The final step requires you to provide the repo source details in the **Repository form**. The repository can either be an existing source or a newly created one.

6. In the Repository form, make sure to specify the git repository service used by your Organization. KintoBlocks supports GitHub and Bitbucket services.

7. Click on the **Create New KintoBlock** button. 

You are all set. The KintoBlock for a website has been created successfully.


# Git Repository, Builds & CI

## Continous Integration and Deployment

Whenever changes are committed to your repository branch, you can trigger a new build for your KintoBlock using **Check for New Commits** button in the **KintoBlock Manage Page**. User can also view the recent commits made in the repository branch under **Recent Builds**. The **Latest Build** section will get updated automatically with the last successfull build.

The **Automatically build new commits in this branch** option automatically enables build generation for new commits in the repository. By default, the toggle switch is set to `ON`.

## Manually trigger builds for new Commits

To trigger a new build follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open the KintoBlock.

2. Select the branch of KintoBlock consisting of the latest code.

3. Click on **Check for New Commits** button.

   {TODO: Raven Add GIF video of clicking on Check for New Commits button and new build generated }

A new build with last commits made in the repository will be generated. The status of the new build will be displayed in the **Recent Builds section**. If there are no new commits in the repository, a new build will not be generated.

## Re-generating builds via Retry

There is an option to regenerate a build from the last attempt to generated a build. Builds can be regenerated for all statuses: Success, Running and Failed.

To regenerate a build:

1. Open the KintoBlock build that resulted in failure.

2. Select the appropriate branch of the KintoBlock.

3. Click on the **Retry** button displayed in the build status table.

   {TODO: Raven Add a GIF video for clicking on Retry button and new build generated }

The build generation process will commence and the status of the build will be displayed in the **Recent Builds** section.

## View Repository

To view a repository, open any KintoBlock and scroll down to **Builds & Repository** section. The repository name of a KintoBlock is displayed right below the Recent Builds section under the title Repository.

The **Open Repo** button provides an option to quickly view the repository that is associated with your KintoBlock.
  
   {TODO: Raven Add image of Open Repo button }

The **View example projects link** in the Repository section provides an option to quickly view an example project of the programming language you have chosen to create the KintoBlock.

## View Build Logs

KintoHub maintains a structured list of the events that take place during the build generation. The entire build log can be generated in textual form by clicking on the **Open Log** button. 

   {TODO: Raven Add image of Open log button }

When the KintoBlock build is a success, you will notice a green banner on top of the Build Logs section with the title `No error found`.

If the KintoBlock builds results in failure, a red banner will be displayed on top of the Build Logs section with the title `Error found`.  Log messages can be analyzed to find the root causes of failure. 

   {TODO: Raven Add an image for error found }
  
## View Build Status

The Recent Builds section also displays the status of each build. The builds can have one of the 3 statuses mentioned below:

- **Running**: This is the initial state of a new build, while we build your KintoBlock

- **Success**: This status indicates that your KintoBlock build was run successfully.

- **Failure**: This status indicates that the build failed. 

Detailed logs pertaining to each status can be viewed by clicking on the status column.

## Tagging a Build

Builds are automatically generated when a KintoBlock is created. Tagging a build in a KintoBlock is a similar concept to tagging in GitHub. Once a build is tagged, the build can be referenced and deployed through a deployment. Itâ€™s important to tag stable builds that you have tested and prepared for production use!

To tag a commit in KintoBlock:

1. Open the KintoBlock you wish to tag.

2. Select the branch in your repository, where you have the final version of your KintoBlock that is ready to go!!

3. In **Builds & Repository section**, click on the **Tag Build** button for the commit that you would like to tag.

   {TODO: Raven Add image of Tag build button in Builds & Repository section }

4. Now specify the build number. We use the form  `MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION` for build numbers.

   {TODO: Raven Add GIF video of entering tag number }

5. Enter the release notes in the Notes section and then click on the **Tag Build**.

> Note: Tagging is important when you are preparing for public releases.  If you want to update the deployment and add a KintoBlock to it, create a tag and select the tag within the deployment. This is an easy way to control the released versions of your KintoBlock.


# Environment Variables

## What are the Environment Variables?

Environment variables are used to control static information specified in the Deployment. These are often configuration values like `Private_Keys` or `Port`. Environment variables aid in providing compatibility for Deployments to run seamlessly on multiple environments. They are specific to a **branch** of a KintoBlock, so if you switch branches and want to use that particular branch in a Deployment you will need to input the **Environment Variables** on that branch too.

It is recommended to add **Environment value** while a variable is created. The Environment values can be added on the **KintoBlock manage page** or via **Configure Dependencies** button in Deployment Manage Page.

## How to define Environment variables in a KintoBlock?

The Environment variables can be added to a KintoBlock on the **KintoBlock Manage page** by following the steps mentioned below:

1. Open the KintoBlock.

2. Select the required branch in your repository.

3. Scroll down to the **Environment Variable** section at the bottom of the form.

   { TODO : Raven Add image of environment variable section }

4. Add the **Variable name** and set the default value. Users can override the default value before they deploy.

5. Click on the **+** button.

6. By default, each variable added will be regarded as an optional variable. If you would like to mandate the use of any specific variable, enable the **This is a required value option**.

   {TODO: Raven Add GIF video of enabling "This is a required value option switch" }
 
## Manage Environment Variables

It is possible to edit and delete an Environment variable in KintoBlock at any required point. The edit and delete operations are also carried out in the **KintoBlocks Manage page**:

1. Open the KintoBlock.

2. Select the required branch in your repository.

3. Scroll down to the **Environment Variable** section at the bottom of the form.

4. To edit, overwrite the existing Variable and Value with the updated values.

5. To delete, click on the **X** icon displayed beside an environment variable.

6. Click on the **Save Changes** button to apply the changes.

### Points to remember about Environment Variables

- The owner of a KintoBlock can add, edit or delete Environment variables and values.
- Public users with access to a KintoBlock can edit the environment values via **Configure Dependencies** button in Deployment Manage page.


# Manage KintoBlocks

## Editing KintoBlocks

The KintoBlock properties like `Description`, `Port`, `Build command`, `Run` and `Doc format` specified during creation can be edited and modified with new values.

To edit a KintoBlock follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open a KintoBlock.

2. Click on the **pencil icon** displayed beside the title to modify the Description of the KintoBlock.

3. Scroll down to **Builds & Repository** section.

4. Expand **Advanced Options** to view the `Port`, `Build command`, `Run`, and `Doc` fields

5. Specify new values wherever necessary.

6. Click on the **Save Changes** button to apply changes.

## Edit Branches & Tags

KintoBlock syncs with the repository and automatically updates new branches and tags added to it. There is no option within KintoBlocks to modify the branches and tags.

## Add to Deployments

KintoBlocks can be added straight away to any deployments in your workspace.

To add KintoBlocks to Deployments.

1. Open the KintoBlock.

2. Click on **Add To Deployments** button displayed on the bottom right of the **KintoBlock Manage page**.

3. In the pop-up dialog displaying the deployments in the workspace, select the environment.

4. Once the environment is selected, the **Deployment Manage page** is displayed and the KintoBlock is added to the deployment.

   {TODO: Raven Add GIF video of clicking Add to Deployments button and KintoBlock gets added to deployment }

5. Click on **Deploy** at the bottom right of the page to push the new changes to your deployments.

## View Endpoints

Endpoint references pass the information needed to access a web service endpoint. This information is essential to access a service in KintoBlock. 

To view endpoint documentation:

1. Open any KintoBlock.

2. Click the **View Endpoints** button on top right of the **KintoBlock Manage page**.

3. The **Endpoints Documentation page** consists of two sections:

   a. **Search Endpoints section** - The left pane contains a Search field to query and find relevant endpoint information.
       
   b. **Details section** - The details of the queried endpoints (E.g. URL parameters, Response code, and Response parameters) are displayed in the right pane.


# Advanced Usages

## Search and find KintoBlocks

The **Search bar** in KintoBlocks is intuitive and easy to use. The Search yields the lists of KintoBlocks created by **workspace members** and **publicly** shared on the platform. Search is especially helpful for developers looking for reusable KintoBlocks so that they can focus only on building unique components necessary for their application.

   {TODO: Raven Add GIF video of searching a "HelloWorld KintoBlock" }
