## What are Helm Arguments?

**Helm Arguments** are used to reconfigure the default configurations in **Helm Charts**. They are similar to environment variables. Each **branch** of a Custom Service KintoBlock will have their own Helm Arguments. It is also posisble to add multiple Helm Arguments to a Custom Service KintoBlock.

The Helm Arguments value can be added on the **KintoBlock Manage** page or via **Configure Dependencies** button in Deployment Manage Page. It is recommended to assign a `Value` for each Helm Argument that is added to the Custom Service KintoBlock. 


## How to define Helm Arguments in a Custom Service KintoBlock?

The Helm Arguments can be added to a Custom Service KintoBlock via the **KintoBlock Manage** page by following the steps mentioned below:

1. Open a **Custom Service** KintoBlock.

2. Select the required branch in your KintoBlock.

3. Scroll down to the **Helm Arguments** section at the bottom of the form.

4. Add the **Helm Argument** and set the default value. 

    >Note: Users can override the default value whenever it needs to be updated.

5. Click on the **+** button.

6. By default, each Helm Argument added will be regarded as an optional variable. If you would like to mandate the use of any specific Helm Argument, enable the **This is a required value** option.
 

## Manage Helm Arguments

It is possible to edit and delete a Helm Argument in Custom Service KintoBlock at any required point. The edit and delete operations are done in the **KintoBlocks Manage** page:

1. Open a **Custom Service** KintoBlock.

2. Select the required branch in your KintoBlock.

3. Scroll down to the **Helm Arguments** section at the bottom of the form.

4. To edit, overwrite the existing `Argument` and `Value` with the updated values.

5. To delete, click on the **X** icon displayed beside the Helm Argument.

6. Click on the **Save Changes** button to apply the changes.


### Points to remember

- The owner of a KintoBlock can add, edit or delete Helm arguments and values.
- Public users with access to a KintoBlock can edit the Helm Arguments values via **Configure Dependencies** button in Deployment Manage page.
