## What is a KintoBlock


KintoBlocks are the new standard format for microservices.
They are self-contained, containerized, universally compatible, language agnostic, combineable and shareable bricks of back-end logic.

We take off your shoulders the hassle of library configuration, deployment, and infrastructure so you can focus on writing exactly the features you need.

## Creating a KintoBlock

Creating your first KintoBlock is super easy.

1. Select **KintoBlocks** from the sidebar
2. Click **Create New KintoBlock**

3. Enter the required info
4. Click **Create New KintoBlock**

_That's it! You have created your first KintoBlock!_
6. On GitHub, go to the repository associated with this KintoBlock

## Tagging a commit

You cannot add a KintoBlock to an application without having tagged the latest commit. This is a similar concept to tagging in GitHub.
This means that if you tag something in KintoHub this will preserve the state of the KintoBlock at the time of tagging. You can no longer change the dependencies of this KintoBlock.

> You can only create a tag from a branch

The steps to tag a commit are:

1. Open the **KintoBlock** you want to tag
2. Click **Tag Latest Commit**

3. Enter a desired tag number and notes, then click Tag Latest Commit

### Why would I want to tag my KintoBlock?

The main reason to tag a KintoBlock is to add it to an application, think of it as a release, so when you have your KintoBlock finished and want to update it in an application you can tag it and select the tag in the application. This is a way to control the released versions of your KintoBlock.

## Custom Parameters

Custom Parameters are another way to pass information to your **KintoApp**. These values are editable by the end user in the case of shared KintoBlocks, and also editable at a KintoApp level for cases where multiple apps are using the same **KintoBlock**.

When creating KintoBlock you can assign default values to your Custom Parameters and these can be marked required if they are necessary for your KintoBlock to function.

Custom Parameters are accessible inside your code within each call, and you specify when to use them via API doc headers, in a **Node.js** application adding the key to a call will look like this:

```
 @apiHeader (Config) {String} githubToken 
```

This will be injected as a header into this call, and accessible in the usual way you would access headers. In a **Node.js / Express** KintoBlock it would look like this: 

```
  const githubToken = req.get('githubToken')
```

### Points to remember about Custom Parameters 
- Use these to set variables that the customer will need to set or change, like API keys for external APIS.
- Set default values to guide the end user.
- Mark important **Custom Parameters** as required so they are not accidentally left out.
