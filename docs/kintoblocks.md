## What is a KintoBlock


KintoBlocks are the new standard format for microservices.
They are self-contained, containerized, universally compatible, language agnostic, combineable and shareable bricks of back-end logic.

We take off your shoulders the hassle of library configuration, deployment, and infrastructure so you can focus on writing exactly the features you need.

## Creating a KintoBlock

Creating your first KintoBlock is super easy.

## Tagging a commit

You cannot add a KintoBlock to an application without having tagged the latest commit. This is a similar concept to tagging in GitHub.
This means that if you tag something in KintoHub this will preserve the state of the KintoBlock at the time of tagging. You can no longer change the dependencies of this KintoBlock.

> You can only create a tag from a branch

The steps to tag a commit are:

1. Open the **KintoBlock** you want to tag
2. Click **Tag Latest Commit**

### Why would I want to tag my KintoBlock?

The main reason to tag a KintoBlock is to add it to an application, think of it as a release, so when you have your KintoBlock finished and want to update it in an application you can tag it and select the tag in the application. This is a way to control the released versions of your KintoBlock.
